## Title

## Abstract

A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, datasets used. What's the motivation behind your project? How do you propose to extend the analysis from the paper? What story would you like to tell, and why? 

## Research Questions

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
## Proposed dataset

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.

## Methods

## Proposed timeline
In order to carry out this project, we have chosen to develop the project with the Agile methodology (SCRUM).
So we have three weeks to complete this project, we will have 3 sprints, with Scrum Meeting between each sprint.

The objective of our scrum meeting will be to review the progress of the project, to be able to bring solutions to a member who would have difficulties.

Sprints are periods during which each member advances on his objectives determined at the scrum meeting. 

Our objective is to complete the project on 16/12, two days in advance.
In case of problem, delay, these two days will allow us to finalize the project correctly.
