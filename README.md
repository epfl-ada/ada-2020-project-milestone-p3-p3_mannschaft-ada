## Predicting Civil War Onset : what about Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Least Square ?

## Abstract

At the end of their paper, the authors state that "the analyses [...] show that Random Forests offers superior predictve power compared to several forms of logistic regression". Then, when we read the paper, we asked ourselves : why the authors only used Logistic Regression and Random Forest methods ? In this extension we will therefore try to compare Random Forest and Logistic Regression to some other methods as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Least Square. In our analysis, we will try to compare the accuracy of our models with the models of the paper by comparing the AUCs, we will also try to compare the robustness and the complexity of all the methods to highlight the more efficient one. Finally, we will try to pinpoint the more important features when using our models. As a result, we will try to compare these features with the ones from Random Forests and then identify the most important ones in average.

## Research Questions

1. Do Support Vector Machine (SVM) and least square methods are more accurate and/or more robust than the three Logistic Regression models used by the authors ?
1. Is the Random Forest method still the best way to predict relevant data when it comes to civil war onsets ?
1. Using SVM and Least Square, what are the most important features when predicting civil war onset ?

## Proposed dataset

Knowing that our study will compare our results to the ones of the paper, we will use the exact same dataset than the authors of the paper. As a result, the main dataset that we will use is the one provided by the TAs, the Sambanis Civil War dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/173N_XoRXsJBSHcL21xl5rDpdQ9LVAmhk/view?usp=sharing). A PDF document, provided with the dataset, details the meaning and few characteristics of all variables.

## Methods

## Proposed timeline
In order to carry out this project, we have chosen to develop the project with the Agile methodology (SCRUM).
So we have three weeks to complete this project, we will have 3 sprints, with Scrum Meeting between each sprint.

The objective of our scrum meeting will be to review the progress of the project, to be able to bring solutions to a member who would have difficulties.

Sprints are periods during which each member advances on his objectives determined at the scrum meeting.

Our objective is to complete the project on 16/12, two days in advance.
In case of problem, delay, these two days will allow us to finalize the project correctly.
